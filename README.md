# Abstract 
The River cleaning boat Project is an endeavor to clean water bodies with an ambitious mission:
                      a) To clean the water bodies and free from floating waste 
                      b) Reducing human intervention 
                      c) Faster and easy cleaning 
                      d) Remote Operation
The core functionality of this system is centered on its ability to be controlled wirelessly using a mobile 
device through Wi-Fi. Users can remotely navigate the boat within the water body, enabling precise 
targeting of polluted areas. The collected waste is securely stored on the boat for later disposal, ensuring 
the efficient and responsible management of river cleanup efforts. NodeMCU is the main device of the 
circuit via which controls all the components of the circuit. The movement of the boat is controlled by 
mobile application. Battery is charged using solar panel which is a renewable energy source. Motor driver 
controls the speed of the motors and also detect the rotation. When the belt is start to rotate then it 
automatically collects the waste from water.
